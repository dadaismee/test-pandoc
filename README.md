# Paper template
This template is for academic papers. It can be used inside of GitHub, with Obsidian or with Zettlr. 

## Quick start
1. Click "Use this template" and create a new pository for your paper
2. Open this project folder in your code editor — here on GitHub by clicking `.` or by cloning it to your machine (with command line or with GitHub Desktop)  
3. Make a new file inside of the Text folder. It can a section of a collaborative paper or your entire paper
4. Add a bibliography `.json` file to the `/service` folder
5. Write your paper
6. Send it to the repo via git or GitHub Desktop (if it's on your machine) or just sumbit if you're working inside GitHub. 
7. Get a compiled paper in the repo as "output.pdf" file

Here is a [useful video to get started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J86Pm62XM_Q) — you can install plugins right inside of the GitHub code editor!
